## Development workflow

### Dependency management with `uv`

The project uses `uv` to manage dependencies:

- Add new dependency: `uv add <dependency>`
- Add development dependency: `uv add --dev <dependency>`
- Remove dependency: `uv remove <dependency>`
- Update lock file: `uv lock`
- Install all dependencies: `uv sync`
- Install only production dependencies: `uv sync --no-dev`
- Upgrade dependencies: `uv lock --upgrade`

### IDE configuration

If you are using VSCode or Cursor as your IDE, you will need to select the `uv`-managed Python version as your interpreter for the project. Go to `View > Command Palette`, search for `Python: Select Interpreter`, and select the Python version labeled `('.venv':venv)`.

If your IDE does not automatically detect and display this option, you can manually select the interpreter by selecting "Enter interpreter path" and then navigating to the `.venv/bin/python` subfolder in your project directory.

### Extending the template

The `routers/core/` and `utils/core/` directories contain the core backend logic for the template. 

Your custom Python backend code should go primarily in the `routers/app/` and `utils/app/` directories.

For the frontend, you will also need to develop custom Jinja2 templates in the `templates/` folder and add custom static assets in `static/`.

### Testing

The project uses Pytest for unit testing. It's highly recommended to write and run tests before committing code to ensure nothing is broken!

The following fixtures, defined in `tests/conftest.py`, are available in the test suite:

- `engine`: Creates a new SQLModel engine for the test database.
- `set_up_database`: Sets up the test database before running the test suite by dropping all tables and recreating them to ensure a clean state.
- `session`: Provides a session for database operations in tests.
- `clean_db`: Cleans up the database tables before each test by deleting all entries in the `PasswordResetToken`, `EmailUpdateToken`, `User`, `Role`, `Organization`, and `Account` tables.
- `test_account`: Creates a test account with a predefined email and hashed password.
- `test_user`: Creates a test user in the database linked to the test account.
- `auth_client`: Provides a `TestClient` instance with access and refresh token cookies set, overriding the `get_session` dependency to use the `session` fixture.
- `unauth_client`: Provides a `TestClient` instance without authentication cookies set, overriding the `get_session` dependency to use the `session` fixture.
- `test_organization`: Creates a test organization for use in tests.

To run the tests, use these commands:

- Run all tests: `uv run pytest`
- Run tests in debug mode (includes logs and print statements in console output): `uv run pytest -s`
- Run particular test files by name: `uv run pytest <test_file_name>`
- Run particular tests by name: `uv run pytest -k <test_name>`

### Type checking with mypy

The project uses type annotations and mypy for static type checking. To run mypy, use this command from the root directory:

```bash
mypy .
```

We find that mypy is an enormous time-saver, catching many errors early and greatly reducing time spent debugging unit tests. However, note that mypy requires you type annotate every variable, function, and method in your code base, so taking advantage of it requires a lifestyle change!

### Developing with LLMs

The `.cursor/rules` folder contains a set of AI rules for working on this codebase in the Cursor IDE. We have also provided an [llms.txt](static/llms.txt) system prompt file for use with other agentic LLM workflows and exposed the full Markdown-formatted project documentation as a [single text file](docs/static/documentation.txt) for easy downloading and embedding for RAG.

## Application architecture

### Post-Redirect-Get pattern

In this template, we use FastAPI to define the "API endpoints" of our application. An API endpoint is simply a URL that accepts user requests and returns responses. When a user visits a page, their browser sends what's called a "GET" request to an endpoint, and the server processes it (often querying a database), and returns a response (typically HTML). The browser renders the HTML, displaying the page.

We also create POST endpoints, which accept form submissions so the user can create, update, and delete data in the database. This template follows the Post-Redirect-Get (PRG) pattern to handle POST requests. When a form is submitted, the server processes the data and then returns a "redirect" response, which sends the user to a GET endpoint to re-render the page with the updated data. (See [Architecture](https://promptlytechnologies.com/fastapi-jinja2-postgres-webapp/docs/architecture.html) for more details.)

## Backend

### Code conventions

The GET route for the homepage is defined in the main entry point for the application, `main.py`. The entrypoint imports router modules from the `routers/core/` directory (for core/template logic) and `routers/app/` directory (for app-specific logic). In CRUD style, the core router modules are named after the resource they manage, e.g., `account.py` for account management. You should place your own endpoints in `routers/app/`.

We name our GET routes using the convention `read_<name>`, where `<name>` is the name of the resource, to indicate that they are read-only endpoints that do not modify the database. In POST routes that modify the database, you can use the `get_session` dependency as an argument to get a database session.

Routes that require authentication generally take the `get_authenticated_account` dependency as an argument. Unauthenticated GET routes generally take the `get_optional_user` dependency as an argument. If a route should *only* be seen by authenticated users (i.e., a login page), you can redirect to the dashboard if `get_optional_user` returns a `User` object.

### Context variables

Context refers to Python variables passed to a template to populate the HTML. In a FastAPI GET route, we can pass context to a template using the `templates.TemplateResponse` method, which takes the request and any context data as arguments. For example:

```python
@app.get("/welcome")
async def welcome(request: Request):
    return templates.TemplateResponse(
        request,
        "welcome.html",
        {"username": "Alice"}
    )
```

In this example, the `welcome.html` template will receive two pieces of context: the user's `request`, which is always passed automatically by FastAPI, and a `username` variable, which we specify as "Alice". We can then use the `{{{ username }}}` syntax in the `welcome.html` template (or any of its parent or child templates) to insert the value into the HTML.

### Email templating

Password reset and other transactional emails are also handled through Jinja2 templates, located in the `templates/emails` directory. The email templates follow the same inheritance pattern as web templates, with `base_email.html` providing the common layout and styling.

Here's how the default password reset email template looks:

![Default Password Reset Email Template](static/reset_email.png)

The email templates use inline CSS styles to ensure consistent rendering across email clients. Like web templates, they can receive context variables from the Python code (such as `reset_url` in the password reset template).

### Server-side form validation

Pydantic is used for data validation and serialization. It ensures that the data received in requests meets the expected format and constraints. Pydantic models are used to define the structure of request and response data, making it easy to validate and parse JSON payloads.

If a user-submitted form contains data that has the wrong number, names, or types of fields, Pydantic will raise a `RequestValidationError`, which is caught by middleware and converted into an HTTP 422 error response.

### Middleware exception handling

Middlewares—which process requests before they reach the route handlers and responses before they are sent back to the client—are defined in `main.py`. They are commonly used in web development for tasks such as error handling, authentication token validation, logging, and modifying request/response objects.

This template uses middlewares exclusively for global exception handling; they only affect requests that raise an exception. This allows for consistent error responses and centralized error logging. Middleware can catch exceptions raised during request processing and return appropriate HTTP responses. 

Middleware functions are decorated with `@app.exception_handler(ExceptionType)` and are executed in the order they are defined in `main.py`, from most to least specific.

Here's a middleware for handling the `PasswordMismatchError` exception from the previous example, which renders the `errors/validation_error.html` template with the error details:

```python
@app.exception_handler(PasswordValidationError)
async def password_validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: PasswordValidationError):
    return templates.TemplateResponse(
        request,
        "errors/validation_error.html",
        {
            "status_code": 422,
            "errors": {"error": exc.detail}
        },
        status_code=422,
    )
```

## Database configuration and access with SQLModel

SQLModel is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that allows us to interact with our PostgreSQL database using Python classes instead of writing raw SQL. It combines the features of SQLAlchemy (a powerful database toolkit) with Pydantic's data validation.

### Models and relationships

Core database models are defined in `utils/core/models.py`. Each model is a Python class that inherits from `SQLModel` and represents a database table. The key core models are:

- `Account`: Represents a user account with email and password hash
- `User`: Represents a user profile with details like name and avatar; the email and password hash are stored in the related `Account` model
- `Organization`: Represents a company or team
- `Role`: Represents a set of permissions within an organization
- `Permission`: Represents specific actions a user can perform (defined by ValidPermissions enum)
- `PasswordResetToken`: Manages password reset functionality with expiration
- `EmailUpdateToken`: Manages email update confirmation functionality with expiration

Two additional models are used by SQLModel to manage many-to-many relationships; you generally will not need to interact with them directly:

- `UserRoleLink`: Maps users to their roles (many-to-many relationship)
- `RolePermissionLink`: Maps roles to their permissions (many-to-many relationship)

Here's an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) of the current core database schema, automatically generated from our SQLModel definitions:

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
import sys
sys.path.append("..")
from utils.core.models import *
from utils.core.db import engine
from sqlalchemy import MetaData
from sqlalchemy_schemadisplay import create_schema_graph

# Create the directed graph
graph = create_schema_graph(
    engine=engine,
    metadata=SQLModel.metadata,
    show_datatypes=True,
    show_indexes=True,
    rankdir='TB',
    concentrate=False
)

# Save the graph
graph.write_png('static/schema.png')
```

![Database Schema](static/schema.png)

To extend the database schema, define your own models in `utils/app/models.py` and import them in `utils/core/db.py` to make sure they are included in the `metadata` object in the `create_all` function.

### Database helpers

Database operations are facilitated by helper functions in `utils/core/db.py` (for core logic) and `utils/app/` (for app-specific helpers). Key functions in the core utils include:

- `set_up_db()`: Initializes the database schema and default data (which we do on every application start in `main.py`)
- `get_connection_url()`: Creates a database connection URL from environment variables in `.env`
- `get_session()`: Provides a database session for performing operations

To perform database operations in route handlers, inject the database session as a dependency (from `utils/core/db.py`):

```python
@app.get("/users")
async def get_users(session: Session = Depends(get_session)):
    users = session.exec(select(User)).all()
    return users
```

The session automatically handles transaction management, ensuring that database operations are atomic and consistent.

There is also a helper method on the `User` model that checks if a user has a specific permission for a given organization. Its first argument must be a `ValidPermissions` enum value (from `utils/core/models.py`), and its second argument must be an `Organization` object or an `int` representing an organization ID:

```python
permission = ValidPermissions.CREATE_ROLE
organization = session.exec(select(Organization).where(Organization.name == "Acme Inc.")).first()

user.has_permission(permission, organization)
```

You should create custom `AppPermissions` enum values for your application in `utils/app/` (if needed) and validate that users have the necessary permissions before allowing them to modify organization data resources.

### Cascade deletes

Cascade deletes (in which deleting a record from one table deletes related records from another table) can be handled at either the ORM level or the database level. This template handles cascade deletes at the ORM level, via SQLModel relationships. Inside a SQLModel `Relationship`, we set:

```python
sa_relationship_kwargs={
    "cascade": "all, delete-orphan"
}
```

This tells SQLAlchemy to cascade all operations (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) to the related table. Since this happens through the ORM, we need to be careful to do all our database operations through the ORM using supported syntax. That generally means loading database records into Python objects and then deleting those objects rather than deleting records in the database directly. 

For example,

```python
session.exec(delete(Role))
```

will not trigger the cascade delete. Instead, we need to select the role objects and then delete them:

```python
for role in session.exec(select(Role)).all():
    session.delete(role)
```

This is slower than deleting the records directly, but it makes [many-to-many relationships](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/tutorial/many-to-many/create-models-with-link/#create-the-tables) much easier to manage.

## Frontend

### HTML templating with Jinja2

To generate the HTML pages to be returned from our GET routes, we use Jinja2 templates. Jinja2's hierarchical templates allow creating a base template (`templates/base.html`) that defines the overall layout of our web pages (e.g., where the header, body, and footer should go). Individual pages can then extend this base template. We can also template reusable components that can be injected into our layout or page templates.

With Jinja2, we can use the `{% block %}` tag to define content blocks, and the `{% extends %}` tag to extend a base template. We can also use the `{% include %}` tag to include a component in a parent template. See the [Jinja2 documentation on template inheritance](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/templates/#template-inheritance) for more details.

### Custom theming with Bootstrap

[Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your local machine if it is not there already.

Install `bootstrap`, `sass`, `gulp`, and `gulp-sass` in your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev bootstrap sass gulp gulp-cli gulp-sass
```

This will create a `node_modules` folder, a `package-lock.json` file, and a `package.json` file in the root directory of the project.

Create an `scss` folder and a basic `scss/styles.scss` file:

```bash
mkdir scss
touch scss/styles.scss
```

Your custom styles will go in `scss/styles.scss`, along with `@import` statements to include the Bootstrap components you want.

#### Customizing the Bootstrap SCSS

The default CSS for the template was compiled from the following `scss/styles.scss` configuration, which imports all of Bootstrap and overrides the `$theme-colors` and `$font-family-base` variables:

```scss
// styles.scss

// Include any default variable overrides here (functions won't be available)

// State colors
$primary: #7464a1;
$secondary: #64a19d;
$success: #67c29c;
$info: #1cabc4;
$warning: #e4c662;
$danger: #a16468;
$light: #f8f9fa;
$dark: #343a40;

// Bootstrap color map
$theme-colors: (
    "primary": $primary,
    "secondary": $secondary,
    "success": $success,
    "info": $info,
    "warning": $warning,
    "danger": $danger,
    "light": $light,
    "dark": $dark
);

$font-family-base: (
    "Nunito",
    -apple-system,
    BlinkMacSystemFont,
    "Segoe UI",
    Roboto,
    "Helvetica Neue",
    Arial,
    sans-serif,
    "Apple Color Emoji",
    "Segoe UI Emoji",
    "Segoe UI Symbol",
    "Noto Color Emoji"
);

// Include all of Bootstrap

@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

The most common use case for `styles.scss` is to define a custom color scheme and fonts, but it's also possible to customize some other visual details such as border radius and box shadow depth. See the [Bootstrap Sass customization documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/sass/) and the many free templates available at [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com) for examples.

#### Compiling the SCSS to CSS

To compile the SCSS files to CSS, we use `gulp`. In the project root directory, create a `gulpfile.js` file with the following content:

```javascript
   const gulp = require('gulp');
   const sass = require('gulp-sass')(require('sass'));

   // Define a task to compile Sass
   gulp.task('sass', function() {
       return gulp.src('scss/**/*.scss') // Source folder containing Sass files
           .pipe(sass().on('error', sass.logError))
           .pipe(gulp.dest('static/css')); // Destination folder for compiled CSS
   });

   // Define a default task
   gulp.task('default', gulp.series('sass'));
```

To compile the SCSS file to `static/css`, run this command:

```bash
npx gulp
```

Note that this will overwrite the existing `static/css/styles.css` file, so if you want to define any custom CSS styles, you should do so in either the `scss/styles.scss` file or in `static/css/extras.css`.

### Client-side form validation

While this template includes comprehensive server-side validation through Pydantic models and custom validators, it's important to note that server-side validation should be treated as a fallback security measure. If users ever see the `validation_error.html` template, it indicates that our client-side validation has failed to catch invalid input before it reaches the server.

Best practices dictate implementing thorough client-side validation via JavaScript and/or HTML `input` element `pattern` attributes to:

- Provide immediate feedback to users
- Reduce server load
- Improve user experience by avoiding round-trips to the server
- Prevent malformed data from ever reaching the backend

Server-side validation remains essential as a security measure against malicious requests that bypass client-side validation, but it should rarely be encountered during normal user interaction. See `templates/authentication/register.html` for a client-side form validation example involving both JavaScript and HTML regex `pattern` matching.
