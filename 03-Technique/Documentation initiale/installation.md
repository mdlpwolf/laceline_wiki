## Install all development dependencies in a VSCode Dev Container

If you use VSCode with Docker to develop in a container, the following VSCode Dev Container configuration will install all development dependencies:

``` json
{
    "name": "Python 3",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:1-3.12-bookworm",
    "postCreateCommand": "sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-dev libpq-dev graphviz libwebp-dev && npm install bootstrap@5.3.3 && npm install -g sass && npm install -g gulp && uv venv && uv sync",
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/va-h/devcontainers-features/uv:1": {
            "version": "latest"
        },
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-outside-of-docker:1": {},
        "ghcr.io/rocker-org/devcontainer-features/quarto-cli:1": {}
    }
}
```

Simply create a `.devcontainer` folder in the root of the project and add a `devcontainer.json` file in the folder with the above content. VSCode may prompt you to install the Dev Container extension if you haven't already, and/or to open the project in a container. If not, you can manually select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" from `View > Command Palette`.

*IMPORTANT: If using this dev container configuration, you will need to set the `DB_HOST` environment variable to "host.docker.internal" in the `.env` file.*

## Install development dependencies manually

### uv

MacOS and Linux:

``` bash
wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Windows:

``` bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

See the [uv installation docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for more information.

### Python

Install Python 3.12 or higher from either the official [downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or using uv:

``` bash
# Installs the latest version
uv python install
```

### Docker and Docker Compose

Install Docker Desktop and Docker Compose for your operating system by following the [instructions in the documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### PostgreSQL headers

For Ubuntu/Debian:

``` bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-dev libpq-dev libwebp-dev
```

For macOS:

``` bash
brew install postgresql
```

For Windows:

- No installation required

### Python dependencies

From the root directory, run:

``` bash
uv venv
```

This will create an in-project virtual environment. Then run:

``` bash
uv sync
```

This will install all dependencies.

(Note: if `psycopg2` installation fails, you probably just need to install the PostgreSQL headers first and then try again.)

### Configure IDE

If you are using VSCode or Cursor as your IDE, you will need to select the `uv`-managed Python version as your interpreter for the project. Go to `View > Command Palette`, search for `Python: Select Interpreter`, and select the Python version labeled `('.venv':venv)`.

It is also recommended to install the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Quarto](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto) IDE extensions.

## Install documentation dependencies manually

### Quarto CLI

To render the project documentation, you will need to download and install the [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) for your operating system.

### Graphviz

Architecture diagrams in the documentation are rendered with [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/).

For macOS:

``` bash
brew install graphviz
```

For Ubuntu/Debian:

``` bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y graphviz
```

For Windows:

- Download and install from [Graphviz.org](https://graphviz.org/download/#windows)

## Set environment variables

Copy .env.example to .env with `cp .env.example .env`.

Generate a 256 bit secret key with `openssl rand -base64 32` and paste it into the .env file.

Set your desired database name, username, and password in the .env file.

To use password recovery, register a [Resend](https://resend.com/) account, verify a domain, get an API key, and paste the API key and sender email address into the .env file.

If using the dev container configuration, you will need to set the `DB_HOST` environment variable to "host.docker.internal" in the .env file. Otherwise, set `DB_HOST` to "localhost" for local development. (In production, `DB_HOST` will be set to the hostname of the database server.)

## Start development database

To start the development database, run the following command in your terminal from the root directory:

``` bash
docker compose up -d
```

If at any point you change the environment variables in the .env file, you will need to stop the database service *and tear down the volume*:

``` bash
# Don't forget the -v flag to tear down the volume!
docker compose down -v
```

You may also need to restart the terminal session to pick up the new environment variables. You can also add the `--force-recreate` and `--build` flags to the startup command to ensure the container is rebuilt:

``` bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate --build
```

## Run the development server

Before running the development server, make sure the development database is running and tables and default permissions/roles are created first. Then run the following command in your terminal from the root directory:

``` bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8000/.

(Note: If startup fails with a sqlalchemy/psycopg2 connection error, make sure that Docker Desktop and the database service are running and that the environment variables in the `.env` file are correctly populated, and then try again.)

## Lint types with mypy

``` bash
mypy .
```
